# Python was created by Guido van Rossum around 1990 who named it in honor of
# Monty Python.
# Python is an interpreted high level programming language.
# It is often classified as a “scripting language”

# Where to get Python?
# Python.org is where you obtain Python.
# I am using Python 3.8

# What is a Python Program ?
# A python program is a sequence of statements

# Comments : Comments are text that will not be executed.
print('Hello World!!')

import sys
print(sys.version)

# Variable : We use variables to store values

msg = "Let's learn Python"
print(msg)

# Type
# Variables do not need to be declared with the type.
# Python is dynamically typed.
# The perceived “type” of a variable might change as a program executes
# depending on the current value assigned to it.

# Case Sensitivity
# Python is case sensitive. Upper and lower-case letters are considered different
# letters.

name = 'monty'
Name = 'python'
print(name, Name)

# By convention we use variables in lower case
# If we have to separate words, we use underscores

# Eg
my_fav_color = 'red'
print('My favourite color is ',  my_fav_color)
